# Welcome to _Summer Ice Cream_ website ðŸŽ‰
___

Xin chao! ðŸ‘‹ 
This is a beginner-friendly project I built while on my self-learning journey into web development. This project was created using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without any frameworks or libraries, to reinforce my understanding of core web technologies.

### Why I Built This ðŸš€
I wanted to challenge myself by building something from scratch, improving my JavaScript skills, and learning how to structure my code effectively. Through this project, I explored DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, responsive design.
### What It Does ðŸ”¥

This website allows users to browse different sections related to the ice cream shop. Users can be introduced to the shop, view and manage their shopping cart. Cart items are saved in local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
### What I Learned ðŸ“š

* Deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
* Improved my skills in CSS styling and layout techniques
* Gained experience with handling user interactions

Thank you for checking it out! ðŸ˜Š
